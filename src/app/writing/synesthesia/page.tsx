      The words on this page are plain and black, and most likely, you see them
      as just that. Your eyes detect the pattern of light, and special cells in
      the eye’s retina, known as rods and cones, turn these patterns into neural
      impulses. These neural impulses traverse through neurons and get
      transported to the brain via the optic nerve. The areas of the brain that
      the optic nerve reaches organize, associate, and comprehend the signals.
      This allows you to recognize individual words, connect them, and attach
      meaning and understanding to everything from Shakespeare’s “Romeo and
      Juliet” to the lyrics of your favorite song to the words you are reading
      right now. The brain is able to filter through millions of stimuli and
      send them to their respective locations to be processed, conducting the
      perfect symphony of impulses needed to understand what you are seeing,
      feeling, hearing, and touching. Albeit fascinating, this is quite frankly
      boring for synesthetes.

      Synesthetes represent the 2% of individuals who have synesthesia, a
      curious blending of the senses. Researchers of synesthesia are
      particularly interested in the overlapping of a stimulus that is already
      so sensationally stirring: music. Upon hearing a note, synesthetes will
      see shapes and colors that are associated with that specific tone. When
      hearing a sequence of notes in a melody, these images interact to create a
      vibrant landscape of shapes and colors. This type of synesthesia is known
      as auditory-visual synesthesia, and much of the phenomenon can be traced
      back to neural connectivity and genetics.

      When someone without synesthesia listens to music, signals follow a
      consistent, direct path to the brain. When music enters the ear, sound
      waves reach the eardrum, causing it to vibrate in response. This vibration
      causes tiny bones attached to the cochlea, known as ossicles, to vibrate
      as well. This in turn induces the movement of fluid in the cochlea.
      Special hair cells line the walls of the cochlea and sway with the fluid.
      This physical swaying triggers the production of electric neural signals;
      the sensitivity and response to changes in physical posture is known as
      mechanoreception. The neural signal gets transported to an area of the
      brainstem known as the pons, and eventually reaches the primary auditory
      cortex where the sound is consciously processed and recognized. In
      essence, every sound has a unique sound wave that produces a different
      type of vibration and distinctive pattern of swaying. That is how the
      human brain is able to recognize all different types of music. However,
      there is a strong basis for the cause of synesthesia in the alteration of
      this auditory pathway.

      During infant years, the human brain experiences the peak of its
      development. Much of brain development entails what is known as neural
      pruning — the optimization and rewiring of neurons to best adapt to one’s
      surroundings as one grows older. During this process, the connections in
      an infant's brain that are consistently repeated and exercised will
      strengthen, while the neurons associated with unneeded and unused
      connections will essentially disconnect their axons from a synapse,
      removing the link. A comprehensive analysis of the genomes of a family
      with synesthesia revealed that genes associated with brain development
      (i.e. neural pruning) are inheritably linked. Some of these genes can lead
      to the failure of neural pruning, meaning that a plurality of excess
      connections remains even after infanthood. Some of these connections could
      be between the auditory cortex and the cortices of the other senses, such
      as vision. This means that neurons in the aforementioned auditory pathway
      will send signals to the auditory and visual areas of the brain just
      because these connections exist. This is why auditory-visual synesthetes
      can quite literally see what they hear.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Although statistically rare, auditory-visual synesthesia provides the
      unique ability to experience music through another dimension, so it is
      actually quite common for music artists to have this condition. Beyoncé,
      Billie Eilish, Billy Joel, Lorde, Olivia Rodrigo, and Frank Ocean all have
      auditory-visual synesthesia; perhaps a part of their musical talent and
      success can be attributed to the phenomenon.

      So, while most of us can’t see our favorite songs, we get to hear the
      creations of those who can. And still, these songs hold so much meaning
      and emotion, demonstrating that the impacts of synesthesia reverberate all
      around us.
