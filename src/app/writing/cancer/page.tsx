      Off the coast of mainland Australia, the small, sun-baked island of
      Tasmania houses nature’s most feral creature. With a piercing shriek,
      lingering stench, and penetrating eyes, the Tasmanian devil reigns as the
      largest carnivorous marsupial in wildlife. Its ever-growing teeth sink
      into bones and feast on the bloody, meaty flesh of its latest catch. As
      self-proclaimed “lone wolves,” Tasmanian devils hunt solo and are known to
      brawl with their own over prey. And yet, while being physically prepared
      for any possible attack, they are helpless under the restraint of an
      invisible predator that has eradicated more than 60% of their entire
      population. This silent assailant is a contagious cancer known as
      Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumor Disease (TDFTD). This disease defies what we
      thought we knew about cancer, and therefore is a topic of high interest
      for many genetic and conservation biologists.

      Through centuries of research, scientists have noticed foundational
      patterns in the unpredictable nature of cancer. Cancer is the uncontrolled
      growth of cells leading to the formation of tumors. These tumors can grow
      and migrate throughout the body, characterizing metastasis and disrupting
      healthy, vital tissue. The cause of this abnormal growth traces back to
      genes and their mutations. In the perfect storm of cancer, the genes
      associated with cell division and cell death are altered so cell division
      is overexpressed or cell death doesn’t occur when it needs to. These
      alterations happen spontaneously through environmental factors or
      inheritance. This is why smoking, sun exposure, or having a relative with
      cancer are known to increase the chances of getting the disease.
      Therefore, it is impossible to directly “catch” a cancerous mutation like
      one would catch a cold.

      Scientists have considered this principle strictly with the nature of
      cancer and its causes until the curious mass disappearance of Tasmanian
      devils. Researchers noticed that the dead Tasmanian devils had lumps on
      their faces, which were later found to be malignant tumors that were
      killing the animals. However, what didn’t make sense, based on what was
      known about the basics of cancer, was why such a significant portion of
      the population was being affected and killed. Elizabeth P. Murchison and
      her team of researchers at the University of Cambridge spearheaded this
      inquiry, which led to the discovery of TDFTD. By sequencing the microRNA
      of the tumors, they discovered that the cancer was spreadable by contact.
      When Tasmanian devils fight and bite each other, the cancerous cells
      physically move from one devil to another. These cancerous cells then
      evade the animal’s immune system and eventually multiply to form a tumor.
      This refutes what scientists thought they knew about the causes of cancer
      and the genetics of the disease.

      Due to the large impact that this disease had on Tasmanian devils,
      conservation biologists have been working to try to increase the
      population. Isolation of the disease, vaccines, and natural immunity
      development have helped further this goal and ensure survival for
      Tasmanian devils. More recently, researchers have been able to use
      phylodynamics, a way to map the ancestral genetic history of pathogens, to
      assure that the Tasmanian devil species triumph over the disease. So,
      while these devils are not the most friendly of creatures, studying them
      has allowed us to push the boundaries and realize the deviance of cancer.
